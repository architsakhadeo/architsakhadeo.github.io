It is said, “Give a man a mask, and he will show his true face,” I say, every single man already wears one.

There is this valley of emotions between his true self and the one he displays. The person adapts the mask because he chooses the mask over his true self. The mask is relieving. The mask doesn&#39;t show the dark side of his life. The mask is what he&#39;d like to be, the mask is what he&#39;d like his life to reflect.

A smile necessarily won&#39;t mean happiness as silence won&#39;t always…">

It takes a deep understanding of a person to comprehend what the mask is saying. These masks are illusory. But who said illusions are fake?</p><p><br></p><p>Is there even a single thing in your life which you have suppressed behind your mask? Is there anything that has been kept hidden for a long, long time and there are no plans to let it out in the near future as well? Do you not like being your true self or are you just afraid to experience it? The mental pressure to control the mask is not an easy task. It takes a lot to control the mask. As time passes, the mask takes control slowly. It gets into your subconscious mind. And now my friend, you are no more you. Not to the world, not to yourself. But the day the true self wakes up, you become helpless not knowing what to do, what to think as you are no more familiar with your own self. How difficult it is to be someone you aren&#39;t&#33;</p><p><br></p><p>All the sorrow, the tears, the frustration, the depression is hidden behind that face giving no person a tiny clue what goes behind it. I wonder why it is so complicated. Wasn&#39;t life already complex that we needed one more obstacle in making it simpler? People judge the mask and conclude on many things. Is anyone to blame here? Yes, there are things to blame for sure. But what can be a better solution than wearing a mask?</p><p><br></p><p>Will you still judge me?</p></article>
