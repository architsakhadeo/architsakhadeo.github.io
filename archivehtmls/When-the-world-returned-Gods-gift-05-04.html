Borders were formed. Religions were now common. Discrimination was prevalent. Man started hating his counterparts.</p><p>The thoughts for the welfare of the race instead were focussed on the society, then on the religion, then on the family and now finally on the sole individual.</p><p><br></p><p>Money gained importance, trees lost their. The barter system was now completely taken over by monetary transactions.</p><p>Man controlled the world. Money controlled him.</p><p>The age of industrialization came. Farms changed to factories. Farmers changed to employees.</p><p>Men worked in factories. Women stayed at home or worked in factories. Children went to school or stayed at home or worked in factories.</p><p>Useless products were manufactured from useful raw material.</p><p><br></p><p>Life became modernized and superficial. The clock gave life a quicker pace.</p><p>There was a time when the whole earth was home, now the word &#39;home&#39; was defined as a 25*25 square feet closed block built in a building, technically in air.</p><p>Life had changed. Man had changed. The world had changed. Other life forms mourned by seeing the condition of the world.</p><p>And God regretted creating man ...</p><p><br></p><p>The sky was now grey, trees without leaves,</p><p>Ponds without fish, nests without birds.</p><p>Pollution had killed everyone including man.</p><p>Man had thought that he could bypass life, but he himself had planned his extinction the day the first man was born.</p><p><br></p></article>
