The second-most certain aspect of life is death. Everyone here is temporary. People will leave. Some voluntarily, some circumstantially, and most important people by death. My intention is to be as kind as possible to all them and to be kinder to them than they are to me. This is not for the sake of competing but to give them a much better experience than I would give otherwise. This approach will bring more contentment and happiness in my own life too, as it will in other&#39;s lives.</blockquote><p><br></p><p>The intention of this essay is to help me gain clarity on one way to contentment by inculcating kinder behavior. I intend to do this by highlighting the people that matter in my life. This procedure of enlisting people will help me focus on a few but important people. I intend to actively and consciously be kinder to them, to begin with. My behavior will not be exclusive to these few people and I aim to keep it consistent with everyone else. Trying to inculcate this behavior with everyone in the very start is too general a goal for me, to remember consciously. Hence, focusing on a few people seems appropriate to start with.</p><p><br></p><p>Doing this procedure will hopefully help me inculcate the desired behavior which I sometimes forget to internalize and, in turn, exhibit. I have attempted this in the past as well. However, it lasts for a short period of time. After that, I tend to unintentionally stop behaving that way. I think this happens because I take the limited nature of life for granted and forget that my interaction with every single person is limited. I think it also happens because I tend to get carried away in my own thoughts without being present in the moment. I hope that this approach starts off as intentional and conscious behavior, and transforms into habitual and subconscious behavior.</p><p><br></p><p><strong><em>Who are the people that matter in my life?</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p>&lt; a personal list &gt;</p></article>
